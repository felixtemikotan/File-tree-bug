# File-tree-bug
Here is a part of an application that creates a file tree data structure from JSON input. However, there are one or more bugs in this code. It seems that for some data sets this code creates an incorrect tree structure.  Another developer was able to isolate the bug and wrote a test case that simulates the bug. See __tests__/app.spec.js for test case details. You can run the test to see which tests are failing.
